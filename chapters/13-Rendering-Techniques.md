## Subjects in This Chapter

### [13.1 Lighting Techniques](../subjects/13-01-Lighting-Techniques.md)
Rendering pipeline approaches including forward rendering, deferred rendering, forward+/tiled forward, clustered rendering, light probes, reflection probes, and lightmapping/baking.

### [13.2 Shadow Techniques](../subjects/13-02-Shadow-Techniques.md)
Shadow rendering methods including shadow mapping, cascaded shadow maps, contact shadows, shadow quality vs performance, soft shadows, and shadow bias/acne mitigation.

### [13.3 Post-Processing](../subjects/13-03-Post-Processing.md)
Screen-space effects including bloom, depth of field, motion blur, anti-aliasing (MSAA, FXAA, TAA, SMAA), color grading, tonemapping, chromatic aberration, vignette, and film grain.

### [13.4 Transparency and Alpha](../subjects/13-04-Transparency-And-Alpha.md)
Handling transparency including alpha blending vs alpha testing, premultiplied alpha, dithered transparency, order-independent transparency, and weighted blended OIT.

### [13.5 Advanced Rendering](../subjects/13-05-Advanced-Rendering.md)
